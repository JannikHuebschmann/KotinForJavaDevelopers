# Kotlin for Java Developers

This repository contains a follow-along to the Kotlin for Java Developers Course
by JetBrains.
You can find the Course
on [YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMyRywABp_c).

## How to work with this Repo

The Kotlin files are made to be more read like an article than executed as "
real" source code.
However, if you want to view any return values from the functions you can always
execute the files `main()`-function.

Each function is extensively commented and features condensed bits and
nice-to-know-stuff from the course.
This way you can come back to a file to refresh your memory without having to
skip back in the course.

## Progress

This repository is a work in progress as I have yet to complete the course
myself :D
